## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

How to apply semantic HTML5 with responsive CSS properties like ```clamp()``` without the use of media queries.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The MDN Docs was very helpful for researching about ```clamp``` and ```calc()``` CSS functions for responsiveness.
- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - CSS Scan was a nice resource to understand and select a similar box shadow for the card container.
