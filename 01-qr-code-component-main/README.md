- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The MDN Docs was very helpful for researching about ```box-sizing```, ```min-height``` and ```max-width``` properties in the CSS for responsiveness.
- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - CSS Scan was a nice resource to understand and select a similar box shadow for the card container.

My advice to sucessfully complete this newbie challenge is to check responsive properties like ```max-width``` and ```min-height``` because those are keys to solve issues related to the different viewport sizes. Another advice is to check the Discord channel of Frontend Mentor to guide you in any issue you could face.
